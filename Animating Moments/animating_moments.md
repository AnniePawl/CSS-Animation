# Animating Moments
It's important to think about the best time to animate.

## When Does Animation Add to User Experience?
### Orientation
Helps users orient themselves on a page. Enhances user experience by showing them where they are in relation to where they came from, what will happen next, etc.
### Functional Change
Helps users understand what state something is in. Examples include on and off toggles, mute/volume, etc.    
### Highlight
Helps bring attention to important elements on the page. Will help guide users. Insight into what's going on / what and element does.
### Visual Feedback
Reassures that user has successfully completed an action.
### System Status
Reassures users that a request is being processed. Think spinners and progress bars. Users feel better when they know what's. They'll be more forgiving and patient.
